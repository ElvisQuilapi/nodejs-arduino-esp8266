# Microcontroller ESP8266 + DTH11 Temperature & Humidity => API REST NodeJS

Hello explorers, I leave you a small project that I did with an esp8266 microcontroller and nodejs.

The idea in this project is to record temperature and humidity from a station formed by an esp8266 micro controller plus a DHT11 sensor connected to a Wi-Fi. Through a POST method it sends the information to the nodejs API.
